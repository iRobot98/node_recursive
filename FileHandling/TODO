1. Outward Program API
2. File I/O:
    (open and use Golang partner process)
    - open file handle,
    - close file handle,
    - edit file
    - live reload/recovery
    - delete file 
3. Multithreading:
    (Golang co-code: efficient subroutines)
    - multithread file server 
        -> open multiple files at once and handle separately (UUID? or just counter?)
    - multithreaded word-search engine
        -> process file data rapidly
